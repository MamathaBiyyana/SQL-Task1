# SQL Internship Task - Project Summary

## Task Overview
**Objective**: Create a comprehensive employee management database using MySQL with multiple tables, relationships, primary keys, foreign keys, and generate an ER diagram.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Database Schema Design** ✅
- **8 Main Tables** created with proper normalization (3NF)
- **Comprehensive relationships** including one-to-many, many-to-many, and self-referencing
- **Data integrity constraints** with primary keys, foreign keys, check constraints, and unique constraints
- **Performance optimization** with strategic indexing

### 2. **Tables Created** ✅
1. **departments** - Company organizational structure
2. **positions** - Job roles and salary ranges
3. **employees** - Core employee information with hierarchical structure
4. **employee_salaries** - Salary history and audit trail
5. **projects** - Company project management
6. **employee_projects** - Many-to-many relationship table
7. **attendance** - Employee attendance tracking
8. **performance_reviews** - Employee evaluation system

### 3. **Advanced Database Features** ✅
- **Triggers** for automatic data updates and audit trails
- **Views** for common query patterns and reporting
- **Composite indexes** for performance optimization
- **Check constraints** for data validation
- **Cascade/restrict delete** rules for referential integrity

### 4. **Sample Data** ✅
- **24 realistic employees** across 8 departments
- **25 job positions** with salary ranges
- **8 active projects** with team assignments
- **Salary history** with increments and bonuses
- **Attendance records** for tracking
- **Performance reviews** for evaluation

### 5. **ER Diagram** ✅
- **Comprehensive ER diagram** with all relationships
- **Visual representation** of table structures
- **Relationship types** clearly defined
- **Constraint documentation** included

### 6. **Example Queries** ✅
- **50+ SQL queries** demonstrating database capabilities
- **Basic CRUD operations**
- **Complex analytical queries**
- **Reporting queries**
- **Data validation queries**
- **Window functions** for advanced analytics

## Key Learning Outcomes Demonstrated

### 1. **Database Design Principles**
- Proper normalization (3NF)
- Entity relationship modeling
- Data integrity and constraints
- Performance optimization

### 2. **SQL Mastery**
- DDL (Data Definition Language)
- DML (Data Manipulation Language)
- Complex joins and subqueries
- Window functions and analytics
- Views and triggers

### 3. **Real-World Application**
- HR management system design
- Project management integration
- Performance tracking
- Audit trail implementation

### 4. **Best Practices**
- Proper naming conventions
- Documentation standards
- Code organization
- Error handling and validation

## Database Relationships Implemented

### One-to-Many Relationships
- Department → Employees
- Department → Positions
- Department → Projects
- Position → Employees
- Employee → Salary History
- Employee → Attendance Records
- Employee → Performance Reviews

### Many-to-Many Relationships
- Employees ↔ Projects (via employee_projects junction table)

### Self-Referencing Relationships
- Employee → Manager (hierarchical structure)

### Optional Relationships
- Department Manager
- Project Manager
- Salary Approval
- Performance Review Conducted By

## Advanced Features

### 1. **Triggers**
- Automatic department manager assignment
- Salary update synchronization
- Audit trail maintenance

### 2. **Views**
- Employee details with department and manager info
- Department summary with statistics
- Project assignments overview

### 3. **Constraints**
- Primary keys for unique identification
- Foreign keys for referential integrity
- Check constraints for data validation
- Unique constraints for business rules

### 4. **Indexes**
- Performance optimization for frequently queried columns
- Composite indexes for complex queries
- Strategic indexing for join operations

## Sample Queries Categories

1. **Basic Operations** - SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
2. **Joins and Relationships** - INNER, LEFT, RIGHT joins
3. **Aggregation** - GROUP BY, HAVING, aggregate functions
4. **Subqueries** - Correlated and non-correlated
5. **Window Functions** - RANK, NTILE, running totals
6. **Data Analysis** - Performance vs salary correlation
7. **Reporting** - Department summaries, project status
8. **Validation** - Data integrity checks

## How to Use This Project

### 1. **Setup Database**
```sql
-- Run the complete setup
SOURCE setup_database.sql;
```

### 2. **Explore Sample Data**
```sql
-- View employee details
SELECT * FROM employee_details LIMIT 10;

-- Department summary
SELECT * FROM department_summary;

-- Project assignments
SELECT * FROM project_assignments;
```

### 3. **Run Example Queries**
```sql
